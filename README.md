# Automation-of-teacher-substitutions
The project is a Python program using the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). It
includes functions for user registration, login, and various actions related to a substitution management
system.
The main functionality involves handling teacher substitutions, including determining absent teacher
periods, finding available substitute teachers, and applying substitutions. It also has a basic user
authentication system with different privileges for administrators and regular users.
The code uses MySQL for database operations, connecting to a database named "PROJECT" and
handling tables related to teacher schedules. Additionally, there is a scheduled task to update dates and
perform necessary changes every Sunday.
